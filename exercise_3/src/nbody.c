/*
* Main Idea: Loop over all Masspoints:
* Do pairwise ApplyForces for the current Masspoint with all following masspoints.
* Example:
* May the masspoints are named a, b, c, d:
* Do (a, b), (a, c), (a, d)
* Do (b, c), (c, d)
* Do (c, d)
* Since ApplyForces applies the Force to both given Points,
* (a, b) is equal to (b, a) and therefore it's not necessary
* to repeat this step in following iterations.
* ApplyForce will update the Velocity of both given Masspoints
* with the calculated delta.
*
* After applying all forces and updating all velocities,
* updatePosition of all MP's to simulate the next timestep
